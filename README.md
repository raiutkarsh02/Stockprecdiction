Introduction
The Stock Prediction Master Model is a powerful tool for predicting stock prices based on various data sources. It combines machine learning techniques, such as time series analysis, feature engineering, and sentiment analysis, to generate accurate forecasts. The model's architecture is built using state-of-the-art algorithms and frameworks.

Installation
To install and run the Stock Prediction Master Model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-master-model.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd stock-prediction-master-model
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip installed on your system.

Usage
To use the Stock Prediction Master Model, follow these steps:

Prepare your historical stock data and ensure it is in the required format.
Preprocess the data, including feature engineering and sentiment analysis if desired.
Train the model using the provided training script.
Evaluate the model's performance on test data or real-time predictions.
Use the trained model to make predictions for future stock prices.
Detailed instructions and examples are provided in the project documentation.

Data
This repository includes a sample dataset (data.csv) to help you get started. However, you can use your own historical stock data by replacing the file with your dataset. Ensure the data is formatted correctly with the necessary columns, such as date, open, high, low, close, and volume.

Model Training
To train the Stock Prediction Master Model, execute the training script train.py. This script handles the data preprocessing, model creation, training, and saving the trained model.

Example command: python train.py --data data.csv --model model.pkl

Evaluation
The performance of the Stock Prediction Master Model can be evaluated using various metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and accuracy. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. You can evaluate the model using the provided evaluation script.

Example command: python evaluate.py --data test_data.csv --model model.pkl
